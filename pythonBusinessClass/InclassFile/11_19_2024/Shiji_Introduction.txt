The Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji) consists of 130 volumes and was an imperial court edition. It was written by Sima Qian during the Han Dynasty, with supplements by Chu Shaosun. Details of Sima Qian's life can be found in his biography in the Book of Han. According to Zhang Yan's account cited in Zhang Shoujie's Zhengyi, Chu Shaosun was from Yingchuan and served as a court scholar during the reigns of Emperors Yuan and Cheng. Another account, citing the Chu Yi Family Chronicle, states that he was the grandson of Chu Da's younger brother (Chu Da being the Chancellor of Liang). This account says he became a court scholar during Emperor Xuan's reign, lived in Pei, and studied under the great Confucian scholar Wang Shi, earning him the title of "Master." These two accounts differ, though the time gap between late Emperor Xuan's reign and early Emperor Cheng's reign was only seventeen or eighteen years, so the discrepancy isn't too significant.

Examining Sima Qian's own preface, the work comprised 12 Basic Annals, 10 Tables, 8 Treatises, 30 Hereditary Houses, and 70 Biographies, totaling 130 chapters. His biography in the Book of Han mentions that only ten chapters were missing, without specifying which ones. Zhang Yan's commentary suggests that after Sima Qian's death, the missing chapters were the Annals of Emperor Jing, Annals of Emperor Wu, Treatise on Rites, Treatise on Music, Treatise on Military Affairs, Table of Officials Since the Rise of Han, Biographies of Diviners, Hereditary House of the Three Kings, Biographies of Fortune-tellers, and Biographies of Ju Jin. However, Liu Zhiji's Shitong argues that these ten chapters were never completed and only existed as titles, refuting Zhang Yan's interpretation.

Current examination of the Biographies of Diviners and Fortune-tellers shows both "The Grand Historian says" and "Master Chu says" annotations, which clearly indicates supplementary additions to incomplete sections. Liu Zhiji's interpretation should be considered correct. However, the "Bibliography" section of the Book of Han lists the Records of the Grand Historian as having 130 chapters without mentioning any missing pages, suggesting that the official version at that time had already incorporated Chu Shaosun's supplements. Both the Biographies of Diviners and Fortune-tellers contain records of officials serving as palace attendants, indicating that this work must have been presented to the emperor, hence this designation. As for the "Master" in "Master Chu says," could this be a later addition used for distinction? Zhou Mi's Qidong Yeyu excerpts the line "Yang Xiong considered such ornate prose to persuade one in a hundred" from the commentary on Sima Xiangru's biography, and also quotes "During Emperor Ping's Yuanshi period, an imperial decree..." from the Biography of Gongsun Hong.
